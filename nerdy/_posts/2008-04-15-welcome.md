This is my blog for stuff that I work, or even play with, mostly computer code. If any of this is useful to anybody but me, that's well and good with me, but:

	* be nice - use it for good, not bad.
	* be responsible - don't blame (or sue) me for any problems arising from such use.

I put out most stuff here for my own sake, but you're welcome to link to this blog and give me credit if you feel that I deserve it.
