<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
This is my blog for stuff that I work, or even play with, mostly computer code. If any of this is useful to anybody but me, that's nice and good with me, but:<br /><ol><li>be nice - use it for good, not bad.<br /></li><li>be responsible - don't blame (or sue) me for any problems arising from such use.</li></ol>I put out most stuff here for my own sake, so the rest is optional but you're welcome to link to this blog and give me credit if you feel that I deserve it.
