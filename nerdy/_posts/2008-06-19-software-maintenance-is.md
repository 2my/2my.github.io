Software maintenance is:

	* **Intellectually complex** - it requires innovation while placing severe constraints on the innovator
	* **Technically difficult** - the maintainer must be able to work with a concept and a design and its code all at the same time
	* **Unfair** - the maintainer never gets all the things the maintainer needs, such as documentation
	* **No-win** - the maintainer only sees people who have problems
	* **Dirty work** - the maintainer must work at the grubby level of detailed coding
	* **Living in the past** - the code was probably written by someone else before they got good at it
	* **Conservative** - the going motto for maintenance is "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"

Software maintenance is pretty complex, challenging stuff.
