When researching a new tool or a framework API for use I find myself getting tired or bored after spending time doing work that will not be directly productive, and previously I have made rush decisions or didn't "go all the way", thinking that "barely sufficient" = enough.
The other day, I started thinking that different ways of revisiting such projects should add real value. preferably, there should be (at least) 1 more person with a fresh attitude who can continue from where I left, and/or do:

	* review / inspection
	* come up with new ideas
	* bring more involvement / acceptance from the whole group

If it is too hard to get 1 more person, it may be wise to simulate him by taking a break from this project and revisiting it later.
