<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<p>When researching a new tool or a framework API for use I find myself getting tired or bored after spending time doing work that will not be directly productive, and previously I have made rush decisions or didn't "go all the way", thinking that "barely sufficient" = enough.</p><p>The other day, I started thinking that different ways of revisiting such projects should add real value. preferably, there should be (at least) 1 more person with a fresh attitude who can continue from where I left, and/or do:</p><ul><li>review / inspection</li><li>come up with new ideas</li><li>bring more involvement / acceptance from the whole group</li></ul><p>If it is too hard to get 1 more person, it may be wise to simulate him by taking a break from this project and revisiting it later.</p><p>Â </p>
