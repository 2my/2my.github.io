Here's vast areas of wilderness and barely touched </small></big><big><small>nature</small></big><big><small>.<br/><br/>If you enjoy climbing mountains and walking for a day to get from one cabin to the next, you'll have a blast - there are publicly available cabins where you can sleep at decent prices (ww.turistforeningen.no). Bring all you need: food, tent, company and <b>survival skills</b>. Seriously - you'll be on your own except near cabins, and summer here is not the same as warm, fair weather.<br/><br/>For a more convenient 3 day round-trip through the highlights of Southern Norwegian nature, see http://www.visitnorway.com/MWTemplates/QWFeature.aspx?id=183168<br/>Hurtigruten.com offers one of the world's most beautiful cruises.<br/><br/>If u can't wait for winter to go skiing, there are a couple of ski slopes open.<br/>Some of the other ski slopes are now open for downhill MTB and other crazy stuff.<br/><br/>If you want to party on, probably best to stay in Oslo, Bergen or Tromsø.<br/>Tromsø is quite small but lively. Neither Oslo nor Bergen are big, metropolitan cities, but that's the only places you'll experience some kind of city-culture.<br/>I guess here's some places for head-bangers, check www.heavymetal.no. (http://www.visitoslo.com/).<br/>Some decent jazz may be found. Check www.oslojazz.no if you're here 11. - 16. august 2008.<br/>Rock festivals must be planned early - they're mostly sold out or done with come august.<br/><br/>Staying may be expensive, lest you bring your own tent.<br/>Normally you'd expect EUR 50 - 100 for a basic hotel room.<br/>You'll find budget hostel bed in Oslo at NOK 200 = EUR 25 http://www.ankerhostel.no/<br/>At the closed ski resorts you'll get an apartment for EUR 10-30, and some of them are good<br/>for extreme sports (MTB, climbing, kayak, rafting, base-jumping, paragliding etc)<br/>Wilderness camping is free, and you walk straight into wilderness from a few metro stations in Oslo.<br/></small><br/></big></div>
