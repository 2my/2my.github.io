As a sub-project to DotMe, I tried to find applications that'll help me organize files
<span style="font-size:130%;">Research:
</span>The article <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2007/07/11/smarter-ways-to-work-with-pdfs.html">smarter ways to work with pdfs</a> sparked me to give it a go, I found some candidates:
Next: <a href="http://reinventedsoftware.com/together/">Together</a>.
Scrivener.
<a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Yep--73594.shtml">Yep</a> (iTunes for pdfs).
<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/49786/2006/03/yojimbo.html">Yojimbo</a> with <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/macuser/news/120794/webjimbo-puts-yojimbo-on-the-net.html?searchString=yojimbo">Webjimbo</a>.
<a href="http://journler.com/">Journler</a>.
Not for me: DEVONThink.
For later: <a href="http://jabref.sourceforge.net/">jabref</a> (bibliography reference manager).

</span>The article <a href="http://danieljomphe.wordpress.com/2008/01/31/8-web-information-collectors-reviewed/">8 Web Information Collectors Reviewed</a> helped me prioritize.
I downloaded and tried <a href="http://c-command.com/eaglefiler/">EagleFiler</a> (1.2.7). After importing some files I found that this was not for me - the application shows every file added in the library browser, even files in subfolders are listed.<div class="iblogger-footer"><br clear="all"/><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">[Posted with <a href="http://illuminex.com/iBlogger/index.html">iBlogger</a> from my iPhone]</p><br/></div>
