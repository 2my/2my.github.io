Urbino, a picturesque Renaissance hill town, is the most visited of le Marche's attractions but few tourists continue on to 
Urbania, a lively and interesting medieval town that was once the summer residence of the Duke of Urbino

Sassoferrato area (central part of Marche) has a lot to see including Roman ruins, medieval monasteries, the Museum of Roman Gilded Bronzes housing four rare life-size bronze statues, and the famous Frassasi Caves, Italy's top caverns
Urbania Chiesa dei Morti, is a tiny church in the Le March town of Urbania that holds an interesting and slightly macabre display. The Mummies Cemetery, Cimitero delle mummie, is in a tiny chapel. A guide takes you into the chapel and tells you about the mummies on display.

That's exactly what you will find at the Crypt of the Capuchin Monks. Located right off the haughty Via Veneto, the crypt is decorated with the bones and skulls of more than 4,000 monks, all arranged into interesting patterns, such as starbursts and crucifixes.)

There is a parking lot at the bottom of the town. From there you can walk up the main street through the city gates and on to the impressive castle at the top of the hill. This is one town in the Marche where you'll find lots of souvenir shops.

Pesaro, on the coast, is an attractive seaside resort with many hotels and good seafood restaurants. Its central beaches are lined with umbrellas and deck chairs that charge for their use but you can find free beaches north and south of the center. Pesaro has a large main square lined with bars, a beautiful Renaissance palace, an art museum, and a museum of Renaissance and Baroque pottery. Its cathedral has a beautiful mosaic floor. Pesaro holds an opera festival in August.

Fano, once the Roman colony of Fanum Fortunae, is a small seaside resort and fishing port. A Roman arch serves as the gate to Fano's historic center. The central piazza has a 16th century fountain and a palace with the Civic Museum and Pinacoteca. The more popular northern beach is sandy and mostly covered by umbrellas and deck chairs for rent while the pebbly southern beach has a long promenade.

Ancona, the capital of the Marche, is a big seaside city built on two hills with its harbor between them.
