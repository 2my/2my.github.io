If u visit Norway

As is plain to see from www.visitnorway.com, the main attraction of Norway is the dramatic nature found in western and northern parts of the country. Here's vast areas of wilderness and barely touched nature.

If you enjoy climbing mountains and walking for a day to get from one cabin to the next, you'll have a blast - there are publicly available cabins where you can sleep at decent prices (ww.turistforeningen.no). Bring all you need: food, tent, company and **survival skills**. Seriously - you'll be on your own except near cabins, and summer here is not the same as warm, fair weather.

For a more convenient 3 day round-trip through the highlights of Southern Norwegian nature, see http://www.visitnorway.com/MWTemplates/QWFeature.aspx?id=183168

Hurtigruten.com offers one of the world's most beautiful cruises.

If u can't wait for winter to go skiing, there are a couple of ski slopes open.

Some of the other ski slopes are now open for downhill MTB and other crazy stuff.

If you want to party on, probably best to stay in Oslo, Bergen or Tromsø.

Tromsø is quite small but lively. Neither Oslo nor Bergen are big, metropolitan cities, but that's the only places you'll experience some kind of city-culture.

I guess here's some places for head-bangers, check www.heavymetal.no. (http://www.visitoslo.com/).

Some decent jazz may be found. Check www.oslojazz.no if you're here 11. - 16. august 2008.

Rock festivals must be planned early - they're mostly sold out or done with come august.

Staying may be expensive, lest you bring your own tent.

Normally you'd expect EUR 50 - 100 for a basic hotel room.

You'll find budget hostel bed in Oslo at NOK 200 = EUR 25 http://www.ankerhostel.no/

At the closed ski resorts you'll get an apartment for EUR 10-30, and some of them are good

for extreme sports (MTB, climbing, kayak, rafting, base-jumping, paragliding etc)

Wilderness camping is free, and you walk straight into wilderness from a few metro stations in Oslo.
