# Secrets of Happy Families


## Agile Families
Morning todo:
- wash
- dress
- eat
- make lunch
- …

Weekly meeting (focus on how family functions):
- What went well
- What needs improving
- How may we help
- What will you work on

### Agile Family Manifesto
1. Solutions exist
2. Empower the children
3. Parents aren’t invincible
4. Create a safe zone
5. Build in flexibility

## Meals
Tradition important, food not so important.  
Typically: 10 minute quality talk, 50% kids.  
Games:
1. 1 new word
2. Autobiography (who, what, when…) - build memory + identity.
3. Pain points: solve problems together
4. Word games
5. Bad and good stuff that happened today

## Constitution
Example:
- Anyone can call for 5 minutes.  
- Everybody gets 15 minutes for themselves when coming home.  
- Parents alternate weeks being right.


## Branding: Mission Statement, Core Values
Communication: honest, clear, open. Even when you disagree.  
Encourage individuals.  
Commitment to family.  
Religious/spiritual well-being: value/moral, NOT denomination, worship.  
Socially connected.  
Adaptable.  
Appreciativeness: care, express feeling (introverts do by doing).  
Time together (doing things they enjoy).

## 7 Habits
1. Proactive
2. The end in mind
3. First things first
4. Win-win (me⇒we)
5. Understand first, then be understood
6. Synergize (build family unity while celebrating differences)
7. Sharpen the saw - renew spirit through traditions.

## Quarrels
Siblings 3-7 clash 3,5 times an hour on average, total 10 minutes. 1 of 7 clashes end with compromise.  

Parents should spend more time fostering good behaviour.  
Parents should spend less time hindering bad behaviour.  

Tips:
- 20 minute joint activity for siblings before meals.
- Siblings do chores together.
- 10 minutes alone with each sibling every night.
- Get involved in their dispute (under 8 cannot manage conflicts)
		- go to balcony
		- what did you do right before
		- what did you do to continue the fight
		- think about the other
		- apologize

Aylar: say your stuff first, then Kayla, and don’t interrupt.

## Conflict
Watch out for:
- When (18-20)
- Language (I/we versus you)
- Length (important points stated the first 3 minutes)
- Body (should lean forward, smile a lot, nod etc.)

### Tackle Criticism
My mind is racing right now. Before er talk about your critique, do you have anything positive to say about…  
Once thinking engaged, ask for reason behind critique.

## Negotiation
- Isolate your emotions
- Go to the balcony (for overview)
- Step to their side
- Don’t reject, reframe
- Build them a golden bridge
- Remember: this is not the last time!

- Curious about other sides story
- Tell your own story second (tell how you feel)
- Create a third story together
- Remember: this is not the last story

- Wisdom of crowds (mix of strong and weak ties).  
- Vote first, talk later.  
- Hold a premortem (prospective hindsight).  
- Have 2 or more women in the room.  

## Allowances
Talk about finances
Take off training wheels (let them choose)
Accept their passions
Part-time jobs are great for kids (does not negatively affect other stuff, shown in several studies)


## Sex Talk
- it is never to early
- it is easier with 9 year-olds than with 14 year-olds
- a little bit goes along way

From girls:
be open
don’t gross out
never get mad
relax (you’re not allowing it)

## Love Languages
- Words of affirmation
- Gifts
- Acts of service
- Quality time
- Physical touch

Tips:
- Put yourself first
- Rethink date night (unusual/different activities)
- Double date
- Family night

Form religion
- Joy
- Forgiveness
- Resilience

## Home
- Describe image of new home with 10 adjectives
- What is favourite building, and why
- Describe a memorable characteristic or important living space from your past
