Subversion is included with XCode and documented in XCodeUserGuide. Excerpt:

	1 svnadmin create /Volumes/LACIE/svnrep
	2 svn import -m "prosjekt for jobbs√∏k" /Users/tommy/Documents/Projects/archive/mycontacts file:///Volumes/LACIE/svnrep/mycontacts
	3 svn checkout file:///Volumes/LACIE/svnrep/mycontacts mycontacts

Added project "HobbyCode" as well, poms do not work yet - need to mkdir target...
