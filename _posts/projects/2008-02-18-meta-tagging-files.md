## Literature study:
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/tags/metadata-as-a-filing-system-169971.php">Metadata as a 'filing system'</a>, <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2007/02/01/using-metadata-effectively-in-os-x/" title="Permanent Link: Using Metadata Effectively in OS X">Using Metadata Effectively in OS X</a>, <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2007/02/09/2nd-metadata-post/" title="Permanent Link: Metadata in OS X: Part Two">Metadata in OS X: Part Two</a>, <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2007/03/01/metadata-in-os-x-wrap-up/" title="Permanent Link: Metadata in OS X: Wrap Up">Metadata in OS X: Wrap Up</a>

## Why?
A file should be in a fixed place from the moment I start using it. I should never have to search for latest and greatest version of a file, and backup should not be filled with copies of the same file in different locations.
## Therefore
I keep a vast archive of projects, into which files are stored, and a current-folder which links to said archive. When I download files, I will move them into project archive before I open.

## Problems are
A file does not always fit into a project, I may need some general categories as well.
Some files may be fundamental to more than 1 project (such as Quicksilver manual).
Some files (such as video) may be too large for them to be located on working disc.
With lots of small projects, this is not a good solution.

## Categories:
	* audio, video, photo
	* pg
	* travel
	* toy / gadget
	* design
	* computing / programming / java

## Some tags:
	* project:dotflickr, project:dotblogger, project:dotmeta, project:dotfixlinks
	* project:dotinventory (music / file / photo listing code), project:video
	* project:pgcourse2_05
	* project:macuse, project:macdev
	* project:jobsearch, project:housing, project:postgrado
	* project:current
	* go2:rsa06, go2:mex04, go2:mex08 
	* category:pgcourse, category:pgsite
	* category:met
	* category:toy:iPod, category:toy:eyeTV, category:toy:gps
	* rating:3
	* source:http://www.nki.no/ (file downloaded from)
	* synch:flickr:{id}<id></id>
	* synch:svn:{command}
	* geo:pos:{coordinates}
	* geo:address:Oslo, Norway
	* expiry:{date}

## <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> and tagging (<a href="http://theappleblog.com/2005/05/16/spotlight-comments-using-quicksilver/">quicksilver spotlight tagging</a>## ):
ctrl+space to start
apple+g to load selected files
(i assigned alt+space as trigger to open qs with selection)
"tag" to get add tag action, hit enter and write tag
From tag: "->" to get list of tag, select tag and one more "->" to get list of files

## Necessary maintenance of tags

	* Synch / publish with svn, blogger, flickr etc.
	* Add remove from list of current / work-mode
	* rename tags
	* split / merge

process active tags:

	* delete expired
	* mail reminders
	* move resources, workflow tasks

group / relate tags - build thesaurus. Inspiration?
fetch tags or resources from application (ScrapBook)
