I attended JavaZone 2008 in Oslo Spektrum. I quite enjoyed it, though there was not so much hype stuff this year, I guess that new and emerging languages was supposed to fill that role?

<big>New languages: Groovy</big>

seemed to provide most utility reducing lines of code. That seems to be a good thing until you consider that the biggest shrinkage is accomplished by creating get'ers and set'ers behind the scene.

Meta-programming, now we're talking

<big>New languages: Scala</big>

Scala does provide an inclination towards writing immutable objects, and thus thread-safe code.

<big>How to implement a dynamic (web-based) map</big>

Vector-based maps can be bought from Statens kartverk, publishing rights sold separately.

WMS: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service'>Web Map Service</a>.

Commersial: Google, Microsoft, Yahoo

Open: <a href='http://ka-map.maptools.org/'>ka-map</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLayers'>OpenLayers</a>.

OpenLayers can wrap commercial service for later substitution.

<big>Test smells</big>

Test duplicates code

Too many expectations (should do 1 thing)

Too many dependencies

Confused Object

Exposed implementation

Test setup requires magic

I always enjoy good speakers, among this year's celebrities:

	* focus on throughput not utilization (don't fill schedules).
	* Don't put work in a long queue that won't be processed, say no.
