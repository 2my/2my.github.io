	* How much time do I have?
	* What time of the day?
	* What's the venue like?
	* Who is in the audience?
	* What is their background?
	* What do they expect of me / us?
	* Why was I asked to speak?
	* What do I want them to do?
	* What visual medium is most appropriate for this particular situation and audience?
	* What is the fundamental purpose of my talk?
	* What's the stiry here?

	* What is my absolutely central point?


All the time, ask:
	* What is your point?
	* Why does it matter?
