## Question 5.1 - Concept Testing

I wanted to do a concept selection test. Purchase intent is not very interesting because I do this project for my own benefit and not for business. I made 2 small models, or prototypes, that I used to explain the concepts before I asked the respondents to choose the solution they preferred.  
I also explored an evolution of concept J from week 4 while prototyping, and decided to go on with the improvement so that concept J now is 2 boxes that fit together (not a table that fits a box).

## Explanation of Problem and Solution Concepts

**Problem:**  
I want a portable workshop that stow nicely in our crammed apartment store-room and is suitable for doing heavy-duty or messy wood- and metalwork such as sawing and painting.  

**I have 3 concepts to choose from:**  

1.  One large box (lwh 90*40*50 cm). It will be heavy and sturdy. (Concept B from week 4)
2.  Two half-size boxes (lwh 45*40*50 cm), that I place next to each other for a big workspace, or use one for smaller jobs. (Concept K from week 4)
3.  Two boxes that fit into one another when stored, but can be separated and combined to make a workspace almost twice the size of the above solutions. (Concept J from week 4)

Of the respondents, 4 chose Concept J and 1 chose concept K (2 boxes). 2 respondents were quite eager about Concept J and we played around with the boxes a while and discussed further improvements.

Here are the two boxes I made, one is upside down to show how they fit into each other for storage.
In order to fit in storeroom, each box must be smaller than the single big box (50*90 cm). Probably around 47 cm high and 87 cm long.
I indicated the bench plates (work surface) with white paper and/or thick white foam, while the other walls are made of thinner cardboard of some darker color.

Placed together for a high and big workspace. The bottom box adds sturdiness (and weight). Note that there are bench plates on both the top and the side, so that I can choose to have a high or a low configuration.

And placed together for a low configuration, with even bigger workspace (94*87 cm).

Ready for storage.

After doing the user survey, I wanted to see if I could make recesses so that I could have the full 40*90cm workbench, and so I made the sketches below.
