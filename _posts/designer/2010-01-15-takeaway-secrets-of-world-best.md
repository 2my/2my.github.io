I tried to extract what I could use from MacWorlds article <a href='http://www.macworld.com/article/144950/2010/01/secrets.html'>Secrets of the world's best designers and illustrators</a>, eliminating tips on Photoshop, Illustrator etc. Here's the list:

Tip 1

“Developing, building, and stubbornly maintaining a successful visual style will ultimately kill your creativity–and your career. Change constantly or die.”

Bob Staake, illustrator, winner: Time Best Magazine Cover 2008

Tip 3

“Think before you start to work. Something should be in your head or your sketchbook before you switch on your Mac. I never let my Mac control me–he knows his place; he is only a tool that helps me execute my thoughts.”

Noma Bar, illustrator, creator of the new book, Negative Space 

Tip 5

“Brainstorm and rapidly prototype–force yourself to come up with as many ideas as you can, but spend no more than five minutes on each one. It’s surprising how quickly this can expose ideas that work and those that don’t. Often, ideas you least expect work best.”

Simon Crab, co-founder, digital agency Lateral 

Tip 7

“Create seminal pieces that tell the world about what you love, where you draw inspiration from, and where your enthusiasm peaks. This could attract a dream client or collaborators you share a common bond with. I love nature, so I create pieces to attract clients needing something nature-themed, to work together promoting, recreating, or enthusing over nature.”

Ben O’Brien, illustrator and creator of the Speakerdog line of paper toys

Tip 10

“Work without distractions such as ‘new e-mail’ alerts, and play your favorite music–that which affects you–to do your best work.”

David Carson, designer, and author of bestselling book The End of Print.

Tip 11

“Aim to spend a day entirely focused on creating one particularly special piece of work. Do everything you can to make this possible–avoid distractions in your schedule, and ensure you’ve had a good night’s rest and have a clear desk.”

Alex Mathers, illustrator and admirer of bold, simple, smooth forms

Tip 14

“To work as an illustrator, don’t think you need to be born talented–it’s not about holding the best cards, but playing the ones you have well. Know yourself, work hard, and understand your weaknesses, but also what you’re good at.”

Murilo Maciel, illustrator and designer for clients including Pizza Hut and Sony

Tip 28

“Keep a collection of sketchbooks. One for ideas, concepts, and thoughts, one for inspiration and accumulated stuff you like, and one for your own work, stuff in progress, experimentation, and alternate client proposals. Keep the ideas sketchpad handy, as you never know when that ‘Eureka!’ moment will hit you on a bus, out in the park, or in bed just before you fall asleep.”

Johann Chan, art editor, Digital Arts and CIO

Tip 30

“Try to find time to read books, listen to music, watch movies, and do sport. I spend so much time in front of the computer that I need to give my eyes, body, mind, and spirit a break from time to time.”

Catalina Estrada, illustrator and designer for print, fashion items, and consumer goods
