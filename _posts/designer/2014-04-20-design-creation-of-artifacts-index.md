## Just hatched...

This site is being grown, very slowly. For the moment I use it for the course (mooc) [Design - Creation of Artifacts in Society](https://www.coursera.org/course/design).  

My name is Tommy Skodje, and I am a software systems developer / consultant living in Oslo, Norway. I was born in 1971, now I am married with kids. I have a keen interest in functional design, User interaction in particular, but also electronics, mechanical devices, furniture and stuff made of cloth.
