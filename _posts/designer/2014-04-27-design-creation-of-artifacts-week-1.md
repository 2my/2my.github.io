Note: this post was made after Assignment 1 submission (so I should be graded from other posts below). I changed my mind, so from Assignment 2 I chose another gap that I will elaborate through the course.

![pic1col][1_folding_table.jpg]
I sketched a box that can transform into a table. This may be a suitable design for wood or metalwork that involves the use of a saw.

Ortographic views of the above sketch shows how table fit into side walls.

I made a prototype out of cardboard that is different from the above design. The idea is the same: the 2 parts fit together to make a box.

The box is supposed to fit into shelves in the basement store room.  

## Question 1.4 - Pen Sheath

Sketch of a sheath that can hold 3 pens of different colors and can be secured on my belt.

A quick realization of the sketch above: I stitched together some nylon, fastened it to my belt with a string and carried it for some days.  

I found that there should be some stiffness to it, or it will be hard to get the belt through, and the sheath will not keep the nice shape shown in image at left.


## Question 1.3 - Sketch of a Chair

## Question 1.2 - Some Gaps

Some (minor) annoyances that has occurred to me the last days:  
1.  * While waiting for the bus, I had a good idea, but I didn't have any writing implements at hand and forgot what it was.  
2.  On my bike I have to lean too far forward to be able to sit comfortably.  
3.  While waiting for the bus to work, I saw some benches, but they were too dirty to sit on.  
4.  I can never remember my wifes calendar - can I make an arrangement to go out and meet a buddy this week or does she have the evening booked?  
5.  My pockets are full to the extent I have to empty them to find what I am looking for.  
6.  These days (spring) the mornings are so cold I need to wear a warm jacket, but coming home from work I get sweaty or have to carry a large and unwieldy jacket.  
7.  I do not have access to a proper workshop. Every time I have some simple repair to do it takes more time to prepare a small workspace and to clean up after than it takes to do the actual job.  
8.  Our apartment is stuffed so that there is no real office space where I or my wfe can get some work done. The extra room we have is used to stack things we do not use and dry clothes. There is almost always a pile of things on the office desk that does not belong there.  
9.  My tools are stored here and there, in their own boxes, so that it takes some time to gather what I need whenever I am about to do something.  
10.  The nearest thrashbin was far away when I sneezed and needed to dispose of a paper napkin.  



## Question 1.1 - Good Design

I love my Leatherman.

It would not be feasible to carry all those tools all the time, but my Charge TTI model is the right size, with a sheath that fits nicely on my belt and rarely gets in my way. I use it to do simple repair so that I keep things working properly and be of help to others around me. It makes quick work of adjusting the seat on my kids bikes and similar stuff.
