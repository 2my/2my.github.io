## My Gap (from Assignment 4)

I want a portable workshop that&nbsp;stow nicely in our crammed apartment store-room and is&nbsp;suitable for doing heavy-duty or messy wood- and metalwork such as&nbsp;sawing and painting.


## My Gap (for Assignment 2 and 3)

I want a workshop in our crammed apartment that is portable, stowable and quick to set up and take down. &nbsp;

I really want to do it because I do not have access to a proper workshop. Every time I have some simple repair to do it takes more time to prepare a small workspace and to clean up after than it takes to do the actual job. &nbsp;I spoke to 3 colleagues and they all had the same problem. My wife too agrees that it is hard to pick up any repair projects because it is a hassle to set up and clean up the same evening. &nbsp;
It seems to be a simple woodworking project.


## My Gap (for Assignment 1)


I want a kit of writing implements that are made to keep with me at all times. It needs to include pens, pencil and paper.

I do believe that such a thing can be made by stitching together cloth and something stiff (cardboard or plastic), which is within my means. It is simple enough that I should be able to assemble several prototypes during the course of this course.
I do very much want such a thing, and&nbsp;I have found 3 persons who would like one as well.
