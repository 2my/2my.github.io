Assignments were delivered via blog-posts on [weebly][weebly].  

## Design Process (Week 1)
gap → (sense gap) → (define problem) → (explore alternatives) → (select plan) → plan  
Usually iterate through process.

### Finding Gaps
List annoyances that has occurred to me the last days.  

How to identify needs

	1 Connect with users
		* Observe in use environment, look for
			- Awkvard actions
			- Homemade solutions
			- Signs (written)
			- Frustration
			- Inefficiencies
			- Errors
		* Interview, 1-on-1 in use environment, make an open-ended discussion
			- Show me...
			- Why did you choose
			- What did you like about
			- What don´t you like
			- Suggest improvements
			- What issues do you consider
			- Observe non-verbal info
	2 Collect raw data
	3 Code data into needs statements
		* as specific as raw data
		* without implying a design concept: -has a strap for long objects-
		* need as attribute: -object is stowed- ⇒ subject stows object
		* avoid must and should (establish importance)
		* arrange hierarchically
	4 Flag latent needs
	5 Establish relative importance of needs

### Types of needs

## Problem Statement Articulated Using "5 Whys" (Week 2)
	why ↑ generalize
	how ↓ specialize

## Explore Alternatives (Week 3)

### Decompose by Function
A function diagram decomposes functions into flows of:
	* Energy
	* Materials
	* Signals

![example function diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014-06-10-function-diagram-example.png)

Pick 2-3 functions.  
Example: "Divide from bulk":  
	* twist
	* squeeze
	* hammer
	* push
	* pull
	* step
	* pedaling

Combine from 2 functions.  
Example: pull + shave (scoop).

### Decompose by Sequence
Example: flow diagram for car rental:
	shop → book → pick-up → use → drop-off

Look for improvements of each step.

### Decompose by User Needs
Decompose by key / latent needs.  
Then combine.  
Example: "Cart as table" + "Cart navigates curbs"

## Exploration (Week 4)
Sketch 10 Concepts

### Concept Selection Matrix
**User need**	|  A |  B |  C | ... |
Portability		|  1 |  0 | -1 |     |
Roomy					| -1 |  1 | -1 |     |
Cost					|  1 |  1 | -1 |     |
Wow						|  0 | -1 | -1 |     |
Elegance			| -1 |  1 | -1 |     |
Sum						|  0 |  2 | -5 |     |

Concepts are scored -1, 0 or 1.  
The *Concept Scoring Matrix* lets you assign weight to needs, and grade concepts on a scale 1-5.

### Prototyping
Focused vs. Comprehensive, Analytical vs. Physical Prototypes  

## Concept testing (Week 5)
Test the 3 top concepts.  
Innovation tournaments  

## Aestetics (Week 6)


## Name Design (Week 7)
	* What is named: product, service or organization
	* Do I need internet domain name
	* What attributes do I want to evoke
	* Some or all standard needs:
		- Evokes the thing
		- Positive associations
		- Easy to say
		- Memorable
		- Unambiguous spelling
		- Legal and practical constraints (domain, copyright)

### Decomposition 1 Generate list of chunks
	* Dictionary words
		- saddle, seat
		- soft, fast
	* Proper nouns and derivatives
		- Bentley
		- Swiss
	* Other roots (latin/greek)
		- velo
		- stadio
	* Affixes
		- pro...
		- neo...

### Decomposition 2 Manipulate chunks

### Name Selection Matrix
**User need**	| Length | Assoc. | Spelling | Tone | Easy to say | Sum |
Werkbank			|  3		 |  2			| 2				 | 3    | 2				    | 12  |
Flexibench		|  3		 |  2			| 2				 | 1    | 3				    | 11  |


## Production (Week 8)
Supply chain, product teardown.
