## Alfa Prototype

For the alfa prototype I chose to use hobby-plates, pine, <2 cm thick for the bench and 0.9 cm plywood for the back-plate and toolbox-part. I assembled with screws. I showed it to my mother, who praised it (of course). Friends an more distant relatives provided better feedback.  
Here is some of the takeaway:
*   It is surprisingly stable in low configuration
*   Would not use it for heavy-duty work (hammering or powered saw) with that plate.
*   It may be sufficiently sturdy with thicker plates.
*   High configuration is to wobbly for anything but paintwork or stamp collection...
*   Nice idea to assemble 2 boxes like than, but maybe put on some protection for the plate that will face the deck when stowed.

The 2 boxes together to form a high configuration. 88 cm high and too wobbly for heavy work. Most suited to light work such as painting.
The box on the right is not complete - I will concentrate on making one sturdy bench before I make the second one.
I found that the supporting, loose piece below should span the width of the boxes - the bench is not very stable the way the piece is put on the picture.

Low configuration - 50 cm high, larger and more stable workspace than the high version. It was just a little bit wobbly, but when I put my wight on it I could use it for sawing and assembly.

The 2 boxes/benches fits nicely together to make 1 boxy thing. I pulled them a little bit apart to make the shot a little bit more exciting (guess you're tired of boxes by now...).
Eventually I will put a box for tools on the second bench, but that will have to wait until I am happy with the first bench.

I "drank my own champagne" and used the first bench when I assembled the second one. Image on the right shows how I assembled the 2 plates in a right angle.
